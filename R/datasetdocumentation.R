#' Artificial data set to demonstrate possible instabilities
#'
#' This is a simple data set based on three lists, which gives examples of models that
#'  fail on one or the other of the criteria tested by \code{\link{checkident}}. This is Table 2 in Chan, Silverman and Vincent (2021).
#'
#' If all three two-list effects are included in the fitted model then the linear program
#' in \code{\link{checkident}} yields a strictly positive value but the matrix A is not of full column rank, so the parameters are not identifiable.
#' If the model contains AB either alone or in conjunction with one of AC and BC, then the linear program result is zero, so the MLE does not exist.
#' If only main effects are considered, or if either or both of AC and BC, but not AB are included,
#' then the model passes both tests.

#'Data from the UK 2013 strategic assessment
#'
#' This is a table of six lists used in the research \href{https://tinyurl.com/ydegfjaw}{published by the Home Office} as part of the strategy leading
#'  to the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The data are considered in six lists, labelled as follows:  LA--Local authorities; NG--Non-government organisations;
#' PF--Police forces; GO--Government organisations; GP--General public; NCA--National Crime Agency.  Each of the first six columns in the data frame
#'  corresponds to one of these lists.
#'   Each of the rows of the data frame corresponds to a possible combination of lists, with value 1 in the relevant
#'  column if the list is in that particular combination.
#'  The last column of the data frame states the number of cases observed in that particular combination of lists.
#'  Combinations of lists for which zero cases are observed are omitted.
