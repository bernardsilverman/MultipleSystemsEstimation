#' Build model for multiple systems estimation
#'
#' For multiple systems estimation model corresponding to a specified set of two-list effects,
#'    set up the GLM model formula and data matrix.
#'
#'
#'@param zdat  Data matrix with \eqn{t+1} columns. The first \eqn{t} columns, each corresponding to a particular list,
#' are 0s and 1s defining the capture histories
#' observed. The last column is the count of cases with that particular capture history.
#' List names A, B, ... are constructed if not supplied. Where a capture history is not explicitly listed,
#' it is assumed that it has zero counts.
#'
#'@param mX A \eqn{2 \times k} matrix giving the \eqn{k} two-list effects to be included in the model.
#' Each column of \code{mX} contains the numbers of the corresponding pair of lists.
#' If \code{mX = 0}, then all two-list effects are included. If \code{mX = NULL}, no such effects are included and
#'  the main effects model is fitted.
#'
#' @return A list with components as below.
#'
#'  \code{datamatrix} A matrix with all possible capture histories, other than those equal to or containing non-overlapping pairs
#'      indexed by parameters
#'  that are within the model specified by \code{mX}.  A non-overlapping pair is a pair of lists \eqn{(i,j)} such that
#'  no case is observed in both lists,
#'  regardless of whether it is present on any other lists.   If \eqn{(i,j)} is within the model specified by \code{mX},
#'  all capture histories containing both \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} are
#'  then excluded.
#'
#' \code{modelform} The model formula suitable to be called by the Generalized Linear Model function \code{glm}. Model terms corresponding to
#' non-overlapping pairs are not included, because they are handled by removing appropriate rows from the data matrix supplied to glm. The list
#' of non-overlapping pairs are provided in \code{emptyoverlaps}. See Chan, Silverman and Vincent (2021) for details.
#'
#' \code{emptyoverlaps} A matrix with two rows, whose columns give the indices of non-overlapping pairs of lists where the parameter indexed by
#' the pair is within the specified model. The column names give the names of the lists
#' corresponding to each pair.

#' Plot of simulation study
#'
#' This routine reproduces Figure 1 of Chan, Silverman and Vincent (2021).
#'
#'   Simulations are carried out for two different three-list models.
#'   In one model, the probabilities of capture are 0.01, 0.04 and 0.2 for the three lists respectively, while in the other the probability
#'   is 0.3 on all three lists.  In both cases,
#'   captures on the lists occur independently of each other,
#'   so there are no two-list effects.
#'   The first model is chosen to be somewhat more typical of the sparse capture
#'   case, of the kind which often occurs in the human trafficking context,
#'   while the second, more reminiscent of a classical mark-recapture study.
#'
#'   The probability of an individual having each possible capture history is first evaluated.
#'   Then these probabilities are multiplied by \code{Nsamp = 1000} and, for each simulation
#'   replicate, Poisson random values with expectations equal to these values are generated
#'   to give a full set of observed capture histories;
#'   together with the null capture history the expected number of counts
#'   (population size) is equal to \code{Nsamp}.
#' Inference was carried out both for the model with main effects only, and for the model with the addition of
#'   a correlation effect between the first two lists.
#' The reduction in deviance between the two models was determined. Ten thousand simulations were carried out.
#'
#' Checking for compliance with the conditions for existence and identifiability of the
#' estimates shows that a very small number of the simulations for the sparse model (two out of
#' ten thousand) fail the checks for existence even within the extended maximum likelihood context.
#' Detailed investigation shows that in neither of these cases is the dark figure itself not estimable;
#' although the parameters themselves cannot all be estimated, there is a maximum likelihood estimate
#' of the expected capture frequencies, and hence the deviance can still be calculated.
#'
#' The routine produces QQ-plots
#'   of the resulting deviance reductions against quantiles of the \eqn{\chi^2_1} distribution,
#'   for \code{nsim} simulation replications.

#' Check all possible models for existence and identifiability
#'
#'This routine efficiently checks whether every possible model
#'  satisfies the conditions for the existence and identifiability of an extended maximum likelihood estimate.
#'   For identifiability it
#' is only necessary to check the model containing all two-list effects.   For existence, the approach set out in Chan, Silverman and Vincent (2021)
#' is used. This uses the linear programming approach described in a more general and abstract context by Fienberg and Rinaldo (2012).
#'
#'
#' If the extended maximum likelihood estimator exists for a particular model, then it will still exist if one or more overlapping pairs are removed from the model.   This allows the search to be carried out efficiently, as follows:
#'
#' 1. Search over `top-level' models which contain all overlapping pairs.  The number of such models is \eqn{2^k}, where \eqn{k} is the number of non-overlapping pairs, because there are \eqn{2^k} possible choices of the set of non-overlapping pairs to include in the model.
#'
#' 2. For each top-level model, if the estimate exists there is no need to consider that model further.  If the estimate does not exist, then a branch search is carried out over the tree structure obtained by successively leaving out overlapping pairs.
#'
#'
#'@param zdat Data matrix with \eqn{t+1} columns. The first \eqn{t} columns, each corresponding to a particular list,
#' are 0s and 1s defining the capture histories
#' observed. The last column is the count of cases with that particular capture history.
#' List names A, B, ... are constructed if not supplied. Where a capture history is not explicitly listed,
#' it is assumed that it has zero count.
#'
#'@param nreport A message is printed for every \code{nreport} models checked.
#'  It gives the number of top level models to be checked altogether, and also the number of models found so far for which the estimate does not exist.
#'
#'@return
#'
#' The routine prints a message if the model with all two-list parameters is not identifiable.   As set out above, it gives regular progress reports in
#'  the case where there are a large number of models to be checked.
#'
#' If all models give estimates which exist, then a message is printed to that effect.
#'
#' If there are models for which the estimate does not exist, the routine reports the number of such models and returns a
#'   matrix whose rows give the parameters included in them.

#' Estimates the total population, including the unobserved population, using
#' the stepwise model-selection procedure of Chan, Silverman and Vincent
#' (2021). Optional bootstrap and jackknife calculations provide BCa
#' confidence limits while repeating the stepwise selection procedure for
#' each resampled data set.
#'
#' @param zdat A capture-history data matrix with \eqn{t+1} columns. The first
#' \eqn{t} columns correspond to the capture lists and contain zeros and ones
#' defining the observed capture histories. The final column contains the
#' number of cases having each capture history. List names \code{A},
#' \code{B}, and so on are constructed if they are not supplied. Capture
#' histories not explicitly included in the data are assumed to have zero
#' count.
#'
#' @param nboot Non-negative integer giving the number of bootstrap
#' replications. If \code{nboot = 0}, only the point estimate and fitted model
#' are returned and no bootstrap or jackknife calculations are performed.
#' The default is 0.
#'
#' @param pthresh P-value threshold used by the stepwise model-selection
#' procedure. The default is 0.02.
#'
#' @param iseed Integer seed used to initialise the random-number generator
#' when \code{nboot > 0}. The default is 1234.
#'
#' @param alpha Numeric vector of cumulative probability levels at which BCa
#' confidence limits are to be calculated. This argument is used only when
#' \code{nboot > 0}. The default is
#' \code{c(0.025, 0.1, 0.9, 0.975)}.
#'
#' @details
#' The stepwise model-selection procedure is first applied to the observed
#' data to obtain the point estimate and fitted model.
#'
#' Setting \code{nboot = 0} provides the stepwise point estimate and fitted
#' model without bootstrap inference.
#'
#' If \code{nboot > 0}, multinomial bootstrap samples are generated from the
#' observed capture-history counts. The complete stepwise model-selection
#' procedure is repeated for each bootstrap sample, so the resulting
#' inference allows for variation in the selected model rather than treating
#' the model selected from the original data as fixed.
#'
#' A delete-one jackknife calculation is also carried out to estimate the
#' acceleration parameter required for the BCa confidence limits. The
#' jackknife calculation takes account of the number of individuals having
#' each observed capture history.
#'
#' A small positive value of \code{nboot}, such as that used in the example,
#' is useful only for checking that the routine runs. A substantially larger
#' number of bootstrap replications should be used for substantive inference.
#'
#' @return A list with the following components:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{popest}}{The estimated total population for the original
#'   data, including the estimated unobserved population.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{MSEfit}}{The model selected and fitted to the original data,
#'   in the format returned by \code{\link{stepwisefit}}.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{bootreps}}{A numeric vector containing the estimated total
#'   population from each bootstrap sample. This is \code{NULL} when
#'   \code{nboot = 0}.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{ahat}}{The estimated BCa acceleration parameter. This is
#'   \code{NULL} when \code{nboot = 0}.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{BCaquantiles}}{The BCa confidence limits at the cumulative
#'   probability levels specified by \code{alpha}. This is \code{NULL} when
#'   \code{nboot = 0}.}

#' determined by \code{mX}. Supply at most one of \code{hiermod} and
#' \code{mX}.
#'
#' @param mX An optional specification of two-list interactions. A vector of
#' length 2 specifies a single interaction. A two-row matrix specifies one
#' interaction in each column. If \code{mX = NULL} and \code{hiermod = NULL},
#' the main-effects model is fitted. If \code{mX = 0}, all two-list
#' interactions are included. This argument is provided as a convenient
#' alternative to \code{hiermod} for models involving only main effects and
#' pairwise interactions.
#'
#' @param nboot Non-negative integer giving the number of bootstrap
#' replications. If \code{nboot = 0}, only the point estimate and fitted model
#' are returned and no bootstrap or jackknife calculations are performed.
#' The default is 0.
#'
#' @param iseed Integer seed used to initialise the random-number generator
#' when \code{nboot > 0}. The default is 1234.
#'
#' @param alpha Numeric vector of cumulative probability levels at which BCa
#' confidence limits are to be calculated. This argument is used only when
#' \code{nboot > 0}. The default is
#' \code{c(0.025, 0.1, 0.9, 0.975)}.
#'
#' @param checkid Logical value indicating whether the identifiability and
#' existence condition should be checked before fitting each model. The
#' default is \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @details
#' The specified hierarchical model is first fitted to the observed data
#' using \code{\link{fit_hier_model}}. Parameters on the extended-MLE
#' boundary are handled by that fitting routine.
#'
#' If neither \code{hiermod} nor \code{mX} is supplied, the main-effects
#' model is used. If both are supplied, the routine stops with an error.
#'
#' Setting \code{nboot = 0} returns the point estimate and fitted model
#' without bootstrap inference.
#'
#' If \code{nboot > 0}, multinomial bootstrap samples are generated from the
#' observed capture-history counts. The same fixed hierarchical model is
#' fitted to every bootstrap sample. Unlike
#' \code{\link{estimate_population_stepwise}}, there is no model-selection
#' step within the bootstrap replications.
#'
#' Bootstrap replications for which the fixed model cannot be fitted are
#' omitted with a warning. If the model cannot be fitted to any bootstrap
#' sample, the routine stops with an error.
#'
#' A delete-one jackknife calculation is also carried out to estimate the
#' acceleration parameter required for the BCa confidence limits. If the
#' fixed model cannot be fitted after a positive-count deletion, the routine
#' stops with an informative error.
#'
#' A small positive value of \code{nboot}, such as that used in the example,
#' is useful only for checking that the routine runs. A substantially larger
#' number of bootstrap replications should be used for substantive inference.
#'
#' @return A list with the following components:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{popest}}{The estimated total population for the original
#'   data, including the estimated unobserved population.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{MSEfit}}{The fitted object returned by
#'   \code{\link{fit_hier_model}} for the original data.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{hiermod}}{The hierarchy-string representation of the fixed
#'   model used in the analysis.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{bootreps}}{A numeric vector containing the estimated total
#'   population from each usable bootstrap sample. This is \code{NULL} when
#'   \code{nboot = 0}.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{ahat}}{The estimated BCa acceleration parameter. This is
#'   \code{NULL} when \code{nboot = 0}.}
#'
#'   \item{\code{BCaquantiles}}{The BCa confidence limits at the cumulative
#'   probability levels specified by \code{alpha}. This is \code{NULL} when
#'   \code{nboot = 0}.}
